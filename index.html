<h1>Andrew Johnson</h1>
<p>Hey Folks! My name is Andrew Johnson, but I usually just go by Johnson. I'm 42 and I have been a high school teacher for 16 years. When I am not teaching, I love to hang out with my small family of 3 and do all sorts of fun stuff. My partner, Dora, our daughter, Valentina, and myself have season tickets for Angel City FC (ACFC), which is a women's soccer team. We sit in the supporter's section called La Fortaleza and we are members of PodeRosas, which is a supporter group. We are the crazy folks who stand, sing and dance the entire match. The entire experience is amazing and it's a great community to be part of. We even do away days and attend the match in San Diego and San Jose when our team is traveling. I encourage all of you to attend an ACFC match soon!</p>

<h1> When I have free time</h1>
<p> 1. I like to shoot and develop my own film</p>
<p> 2. I enjoy woodworking</p>
<p> 3. I play soccer on Sundays with a group called LA Futbolistas</p>
    
<p>I enjoy staying current with the news by visiting <a href="latimes.com">the LA Times</a> since I care about local and national/world events.</p>
